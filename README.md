# BlueNotebook

(Work in progress)

## A modern journal you can confide in.

BlueNotebook is a simple-to-use notebook and calendar app for the modern day.

- **Portable**: Built for the web
- **Private**: Your data is going nowhere
- **Local**: Saves to your browser, offers export to your drive

*Name is likely to change. 

Project is inspired by RedNotebook, 
another free and open-source journal program.
However, there is no association, 
and our goals differ somewhat.

- This one is built for *all* devices using web technologies.
- Data will be written in markdown, a familiar formatting system that humans can *actually* read.
- Support loose-leaf files outside of the one-file-per-day structure, such as a to-do list.
- Built-in habit tracker, by default just for writing daily.
- Offer sync through existing utilities such as NextCloud or Google Drive (hopefully).
